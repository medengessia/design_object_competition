### Project utility

   This project models different ways to organise a championship. It provides three types of competition, which are Tournament, League and Master, and make them gather competitors that compete in matches in order to win, according to the rules.

   A tournament is played between an number of competitors, power of two, and raises an exception when it is not the case. A league is played between any number of competitors, playing twice against each other. A master splits the competitors into groups and makes them play a league, then uses several strategies to select the winners of all groups, so that they form a power of two and can play a tournament to win the master.

   Finally, a system had been set to allow journalists and bookmakers to follow the competitions and make observations to react to each result of them.
