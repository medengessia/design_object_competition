## Project global presentation


### Project utility

   This project models different ways to organise a championship. It provides three types of competition, which are Tournament, League and Master, and make them gather competitors that compete in matches in order to win, according to the rules.

   A tournament is played between an number of competitors, power of two, and raises an exception when it is not the case. A league is played between any number of competitors, playing twice against each other. A master splits the competitors into groups and makes them play a league, then uses several strategies to select the winners of all groups, so that they form a power of two and can play a tournament to win the master.

   Finally, a system had been set to allow journalists and bookmakers to follow the competitions and make observations to react to each result of them.


   To launch the project, it is necessary to compile first the whole code, and then run the different provided mains. To do so, please refer to the parts "Compile our code" and "Run our mains" of the readme. As you can see, there is no parameter to enter.


   The project returns as a result the unfolding of a competition depending on which main one deciced to run. It is list of the matches played in either a league or a tournament or a master, with reactions of journalists or bookmakers, or not. For more details, please refer to the part "Run the tests" of the readme which shows in the end an example of what one can be expecting while launching the project.


### Project's Description

   In the project, a readme is provided with relevant informations. All one desires to know about the code, the tests, the organisation and the way of running the project is well explained, indicated and updated.


   There is a project's documentation as well. It explains all informations about the software. For more details, please refer to the readme, from part "Subject" to part "Run the tests".


   Regarding the relevance and the completeness of the documentation provided in the readme, all informations are updated, sufficient and allow to use and launch the software.


## Software's history


### Git's analysis

   What concerns the team's composition, there are three contributors according to the project's Git. In terms of balance, only two of them have contributed the most at its realisation, according to the content "Contributors".


   The project seems to be no longer active since the last commit had been performed one month ago. Furthermore, the commits have been done each month at the same period, which witnesses a certain constancy.


   There exists only one branch which is the branch called "main", according to the content "Branches". It is also the lone branch used.


   The "pull requests" mecanism is not used.


## Software's architecture


### External libraries' use

   There are two external libraries referenced in the project : java.util and org.junit .

   According to second and third screenshots, there are 16 unused dependencies to the library java.util (10) and the internal packages (6).
